## Description

<!-- To be added -->

This is a academic website with some awesome features, which is been powered by Django and NextJS.

<!-- ## Built With - To be added -->


## Things needed

Our whole project is been dockerized, which makes the local-development setup ease.

- [Install Docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- Ask the maintainer for **dev kit**, which contains **.env** and other necessary files.

## Getting Started

These are the instructions on setting up our project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these steps.

### Installation

1. We recommend you fork the repo on GitHub, then clone your fork:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/aquila.git Aquilla --recursive
```


2. You can then add the Aquila repo to sync with upstream changes:

```bash
$ git remote add <remote-name> https://github.com/syncrolaze/aquila.git
```

3. Start the Docker and make sure that the docker-engine is running

```bash
$ docker info
```

> Using this command check whether the docker engine is running!

4. Navigate inside the project directory, make sure the directory is proper before moving further, it should be `Aquilla/`  

```bash
$ cd Aquilla
```

5. From here, build the docker-images

```bash
$ docker-compose build
```

> This may take some time to complete ðŸ§­

6. Once the docker-images are built

```bash
$ docker compose up
```

> You may see the logs that are running up in the terminal, now the container has been started.

7. Both [backend](./backend) & [webapp](./webapp) has separate commands that needs to be excuted before running the app, do check out those before proceeding further.

**Pro tip: Always start with the backend commands so that front-end doesn't shot any error.**

### Running the app

- Starting the app

```bash
$ docker compose up
```

- Stopping the container

```bash
$ docker compose stop
```

- Stop & remove all containers

```bash
$ docker compose down
```

### Navigations

- Webapp - [http://localhost/](http://localhost/)
- GraphiQL - [http://localhost/api/graphql](http://localhost/api/graphql)
- Backend - [http://localhost/api/admin](http://localhost/api/admin)

**Note: Our project is been served using nginix and gunicorn, so accessing the respective part using the portnumber may not be working properly.**

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/syncrolaze/aquila/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

## Support

Aquila is an  Apache-licensed open-source project. It can grow thanks to the contributors and support by the amazing backers ðŸ¤©
